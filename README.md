# MVC Framework
This is a simple MVC framework for building web applications with Node.js, Express, and sequelize. It provides a basic structure for organizing your code into models, views, and controllers, as well as some utility functions for common tasks.

# Getting Started
To get started, you'll need to install the dependencies by running:

"npm install"

You'll also need to configure your database by creating a .env file in the root directory of your project and adding your database URI:

"DB_URI=mongodb://localhost/myapp"

Once you've installed the dependencies and configured your database, you can start the server by running:

"npm start"

This will start the server on port 3000 by default. You can access the default homepage by navigating to http://localhost:3000 in your web browser.

# MVC Structure
The MVC structure is a common design pattern for building web applications. It stands for Model-View-Controller and provides a way to organize your code into three distinct layers:

Model: This layer is responsible for defining the data model and interacting with the database.

View: This layer is responsible for rendering the HTML templates that are sent to the client.

Controller: This layer is responsible for handling HTTP requests and responses, and for coordinating interactions between the model and view.

In this framework, we've provided a basic structure for organizing your code into these three layers. You'll find a models directory for your data models, a views directory for your pug templates, and a controllers directory for your HTTP request handlers.


# Utility Functions
We've also provided some utility functions to help with common tasks, such as loading models and views, and handling authentication and error handling.
