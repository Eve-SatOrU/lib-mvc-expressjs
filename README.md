# MVC Framework
This is a Node.js MVC library that you can use to quickly build web applications. It includes a number of useful functions and features, including:

*Model, view, controller (MVC) architecture
*Sequelize ORM for database access
*Authentication middleware
*Logging middleware
*Error handling middleware
# Getting Started
To get started, you'll need to install the dependencies by running:

"npm install"

# Usage
## Setting up Sequelize
Before you can use the library with Sequelize, you'll need to set up a connection to your database. Here's an example of how you might do this:
"const Sequelize = require('sequelize');
const sequelize = new Sequelize('database', 'username', 'password', {
  host: 'localhost',
  dialect: 'mysql'
});
const db = {};
db.Sequelize = Sequelize;
db.sequelize = sequelize;
db.User = require('./models/User')(sequelize, Sequelize);
module.exports = db;"

In this example, we're creating a Sequelize instance and passing in the database name, username, and password. We're also specifying the host and dialect (MySQL in this case).

We're also defining a db object that we'll use to store our Sequelize models. In this case, we're defining a User model and storing it on the db object.

Once you've installed the dependencies and configured your database, you can start the server by running:

"npm start"

This will start the server on port 3000 by default. You can access the default homepage by navigating to http://localhost:3000 in your web browser.

# MVC Structure
The MVC structure is a common design pattern for building web applications. It stands for Model-View-Controller and provides a way to organize your code into three distinct layers:

Model: This layer is responsible for defining the data model and interacting with the database.
"const { loadModel } = require('node-mvc-library');
const User = loadModel('User');"
View: This layer is responsible for rendering the HTML templates that are sent to the client.

Controller: This layer is responsible for handling HTTP requests and responses, and for coordinating interactions between the model and view.
"const { loadController } = require('node-mvc-library');
const UserController = loadController('UserController');"

In this framework, we've provided a basic structure for organizing your code into these three layers. You'll find a models directory for your data models, a views directory for your pug templates, and a controllers directory for your HTTP request handlers.


# Utility Functions
We've also provided some utility functions to help with common tasks, such as loading models and views, and handling authentication and error handling.
